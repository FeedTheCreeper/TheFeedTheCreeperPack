# TheFeedTheCreeperPack
The configs for The Feed the Creeper Pack

The Feed the Creeper Pack is a Kitchen-Sink pack that attempts to maintain some balance, but reduce boring grind. You'll find many of the common mods, like Thermal Expansion, Ender IO, and Applied Energistics. However, many fairly common mods you may expect will be missing, like MineFactory Reloaded, Magical Crops, and Thermal Dynamics.

Part of our philosophy in designing this modpack was to include lots of options for creativity, but lean away from the more "magic-blocky" mods. Through all of this was the need to maintain good (decent) performance for players with less-than-stellar computers. As such, several mods from our previous seasons were omitted either beacuse they were always at the top of render/update times or to keep to mod count lower.

There are mods to attempt to suit all play styles, a sampling:

There are mods to increase the length of low-tech/early-game 
* Progressive Automation
* Modular Systems
* Metallurgy

There are of course more-advanced tech mods
* Thermal Expansion
* Ender IO
* Mekanism
* Extra Utilities
* Applied Energistics
* Forestry
* Railcraft
* Ender Tech
* Project Red
* Steve's Carts

And magic mods
* Thaumcraft
* Blood Magic
* Botania
* Forbidden Magic
* Thaumic Exploration
* Saungimancy
* Thanic Tinkerer

Adventure/World-gen
* Highlands
* Biomes o' Plenty
* Dungeon Pack
* Lycanite's Mobs
* Nether Ores

Decorative Mods
* Chisel
* Bibliocraft
* BiblioWoods (Natura, highlands, Biomes 0' Plenty)
* GeoStrata

###There are also many customizations unique to this modpack
The world terrain-gen is controlled by Highlands, and it has been set to spawn most Biomes o' Plenty biomes with custom weighting. Highlands will also correctly spawn Thaumcraft biomes.

Ore generation has been customized to make mining more interesting, not grindy-er, just more interesting. Most metal ores have been dvided up by y-level so that there is no single level at which to mine to get everything. Ore-gen has also been customized on a per-dimension basis. The more dangerous the dimension, the better the mining yeild should be, the Nether uses Nether Ores to give double the yeild, and the Deep Dark has boosted ore levels and density. Additionally, magical ores can only be found in magical places, like high up in the Deep Dark, and some magical places in the overworld reality is thinner.

Lycanite's Mobs have largely been nerffed, they add risk and variety, but shouldn't be as soul-crushing as the default settings.

Storage has been adjusted as well, Ender Tanks have been buffed to make them a viable alterative to Railcraft and Mekanism tanks. JABBA barrells have been given higher tiers and Thermal Expansion Caches have been adjusted to help make up for Deep Stoarage needs.

Compatibily between different mod head-drops has been added.

Project Red can use Silicon from other mods.

Growthcraft has had Biomes o' Plenty and Highlands biomes added for compatability.

The Ore Dictionary Converter has been configured to allow conversion between previously un-obtainable blocks. Highands and Biomes o' Plenty grasses can be converted, Biomes o' Plenty sands and dirts can be converted.
